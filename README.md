# The Ford-Fulkerson Method
This repository contains a a GUI for the Ford-Fulkerson method using Depth-First Search in `MATLAB` R2020a to solve the problem of maximum flow between a source and target nodes in a directed and weighted graph.

The GUI receives an capacity matrix contained in a CSV file as in `matrizCapacidades.csv`, where the entry in the _i_-th row, _j_-th column denote the weight between the _i_-th and _j_-th nodes, and 0 is used to denote that there is not an edge between the nodes.

# Binaries for Windows
If you want to run this GUI, you may want to use the provided binaries.  
- Version 9.8 (R2020a) of the MATLAB Runtime is required.
- If you don't have the MATLb Runtime installed in your computer, go to `Binaires/for_redistribution`, download and install `MyAppInstaller_web.exe`.
